### Todo

- Create a quad mesh that stores data about the coordinates of each vertex, some data to get the vertices from it
- Will need a method to rotate the vertices around a point in space and some other similar to the ones in the previous project

- My own rect class that can handle collisions and position/rotation of the thing, will have the points of it itself or inherited from quad
- Shader program handler to import those

- Good main.py that is easy to read
- Simple ways to draw one image and many for now
